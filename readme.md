# Routing in Elm SPA's

**Elm London Meetup 26/02/2020**

This project contains a few examples on how URL routing could be implemented in
an Elm SPA application.

None of the examples in this project are **the right solution**
for implementing routing system in your Elm app, but more of guidelines that can
be expanded upon, and modified to fit your needs.

## Getting started

To clone this repo localy
```bash
git clone git@github.com:ivan-jukic/elm-spa-routing-examples.git
```

Install dependencies
```bash
yarn install
```

All examples are using `parceljs` for running and serving the web content.

## Example 1

This is the simples example of routing in an Elm app. It is based on simple URL
parsing, with no additional URL parameters. Each route is represented with a
type constructor, saved in the model, and then used to determine which content
should be displayed on the page.

To run the first example
```bash
yarn example1
```

It will be available at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).
